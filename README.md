# FindMyIN100
A ultra low current 1.5v battery tag for Apple's Find My network

This work based on https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/ and https://github.com/biemster/FindMy.

It does not (currently) deal with the evaluation of the tracking data, but rather focuses on the hardware.
The goal was to create a tracker/tag that requires as little power as possible and is as small as possible.

The size of previous tracker/tag was primarily determined by the battery.

Even the 'cut' ST17H66 will be dominated by the size of the battery: https://github.com/Cyl0nius/FindMyIN100/blob/main/Image2.jpg
