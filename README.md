# FindMyIN100
A ultra low current 1.5v battery tag for Apple's Find My network

This work based on https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/ and https://github.com/biemster/FindMy.

It does not (currently) deal with the evaluation of the tracking data, but rather focuses on the hardware (tag).
The goal was to create a tag that requires as little power as possible and is as small as possible.
